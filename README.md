# ELL-students

This project includes data from the New York City Department of Education, available here. https://infohub.nyced.org/reports-and-policies/citywide-information-and-data/test-results The data is available as excel sheets. I converted the school level data to a csv file with Google sheets before I began working on it. 

The design idea for the visual comes from The Upshot. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=D2EEE64DC88FC8BDAC87E6667C100F06&gwt=pay&assetType=PAYWALL

In the ELL pitch jupyter notebook, you'll see me explore borough-wise results, zero in on the Bronx and 8th Grade ELA and plot small multiples for each school. The visual on the story is slightly different from the small multiples; for one, only schools that reported data every year from 2014 onwards are shown, whereas the analysis notebook contains all the schools. In addition, the visual shows percentage change in performance for each school when compared to its 2014 baseline, whereas these small multiples just plot performance over time. 

The text of the story was a final project for my Writing with Data class, and the visual was part of the final project for my d3 class. 

Skills:
